# Compiz4Evar

I've wrote this script, 'cause I couldn't forgot the great User Experience and Functionality I had with Compiz in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04.
Unfortunately, after that compiz was not supported as expected.

Here is some workouts to make Compiz work with Mate Desktop on Debian GNU/Linux. I've tested this on Debian (Jessie 8.2 and Stretch) and it works very well. I assumed that task-mate-desktop has been installed on your system. However this solution should work on XFCE and LXDE, too!

All you should do is just run install.sh on the terminal and then run: compiz-mate-emerald &

I also got an export from my Compiz configuration to eXtrem0us.profile, which could be imported with CompizConfig Setting Manager program. This file is an out of the box configuration file that enables most Compiz functionalities that you may expect.

Happy Compizing! :D
