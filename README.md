# Compiz4Evar

I tried to make Compiz work with Mate Desktop on Debian GNU/Linux. This script is tested on Debian (Jessie 8.2 and Stretch and Sid , x64) and it works very well! In this script, It is assumed that task-mate-desktop has been installed on your system. However compiz should work on XFCE and LXDE, too! (Dont't use compiz on Gnome Shell 3 based desktops)

All you should do is just run install.sh on the terminal and then run: compiz-mate-emerald &

I also got an export from my Compiz configuration to eXtrem0us.profile, which could be imported with CompizConfig Setting Manager program. This file is an out of the box configuration file that enables most Compiz functionalities that you may expect.

I've wrote this script, 'cause I couldn't forgot the great User Experience and Functionality I had with Compiz in Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04. Unfortunately, after then, compiz was not supported as expected.

Happy Compizing! :D
