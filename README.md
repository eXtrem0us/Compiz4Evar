# Compiz4Evar
here is some workouts to make Compiz work with Mate Desktop on Debian Stretch / Sid 

Hello everybody!

if you are using debian stretch / sid

and you have had a good memory about great UX with Compiz in Ubuntu 9.04,9.10,10.04,...

and you miss those days and you are seeking to have the same experience in Mate-Desktop (or xfce, or any desktop, which supports compositing window managers...)

...so, this is what you are looking for!


just run install.sh on the terminal and then run:

$ compiz-mate-emerald &


or:

$ compiz --replace &
